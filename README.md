# SneakerBot is a webscraping python project used for finding a specific product on a Shopify website. If the project is found Selenium will open up a web browser
# and take the necessary steps to bring you to the check out page in your selected size. Once at the checkout page it is up to the use to use their chrome autofill
# to quickly fill in the information and check out the product before it is sold out.
