# SneakerBot 
SneakerBot is a webscraping python script used for finding a specific product on a Shopify website. The bot pulls information from an excel spreadsheet that keeps track of products you are seeking. The user needs to input the index in the spreadsheet of the product and specifiy the website. If the product is on the site, Selenium will open up a web browser and bring you to the check out page in your selected size. Once at the checkout page, it is up to the user to use their chrome autofill to fill in the information and check out the product before it is sold out.
